The project TEIL Biomass Grid Supply Power Project, Sabitgarh, Uttar Pradesh is located at
Village: Sabitgarh, Tehsil: Khurja, District: Bulandshahar, State: Uttar Pradesh (UP), Country: India
(Pin: 203129).

Purpose of the UCR project activity:
The purpose of the project activity by the project proponent (PP), Triveni Engineering and
Industries Ltd (TEIL), is to generate green electricity using renewable biomass and thereby reduce
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by displacing the fossil fuel dominated grid based electricity
with biomass based renewable electricity. The PP exports the surplus power to the grid after
meeting its captive and auxiliary power requirements at the project activity site.
The PP is one of the largest integrated sugar manufacturers in India, and across UP, it currently
operates large grid-connected and smaller capacity co-generation plants (incidental co-generation
facilities). The total installed power generation capacity in the project activity is 13.5 MWh and
the project activity was commissioned on 23/12/2005 for captive heat and power generation
using renewable biomsss.
